Hello Data Scientists,

 

Dan Siercks in our DS785-Capstone course made a good observation about how the “Final Capstone Paper Format and Style Guidelines” specify that the abstract of the final paper is to be single-spaced, however the Guidelines do not mention spacing for the textual content of the final paper.

 

Therefore, in an attempt to clarify the spacing requirements for the final capstone paper I’ve put together the following guidelines.

 

Spacing

The text of the final capstone paper is to be double-spaced.

 

The paper’s abstract is to be single-spaced.

 

Acknowledgments and dedications are to be double-spaced.

 

Begin each chapter on a new page.

 

Do not begin each section on a new page. Sections should follow one another immediately in order to avoid large blank spaces.

 

Do not leave a heading floating at the bottom of a page without accompanying text.

 

Single spaces after a period at the end of a sentence are required.

 

================================================

Hopefully this helps, if you have questions please let me know.

Thank you,

Ethan
